# :sparkles: Linux_Commands :sparkles:

I created this file for reference on the common linux commands used while doing coding, system admin, and troubleshooting/debugging :)

Soon : Mardown langauge (for gihhub files ! ) The Following example is JavaScript in .md file :D

<!-- JAVA comment doens't work here ... ): only html like for .md files (markdown langauge)
//comment?
-->

<!--- Trying JS with and without markdown --->
<!--WITHOUT 
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
-->

<!-- WITH ---- IT WORKS ! :D so cool.--> 

```javascript 
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
```
